# Fierce Web Framework

Fierce is a fast, minimal and secure framework with a user friendly CMS.

It's especially suited to a consulting firm with an experienced team of coders
creating a website on behalf of a non-tech-savvy client who will self manage
the website after the initial build.

***WARNING:*** *Fierce is currently unstable and breaking changes are frequent.*

## Setup a Feirce website

git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=/destination/path/

cd into

composer install

create database

update config (esp. auth salt)

run migrations

go to /admin, login admin/test
